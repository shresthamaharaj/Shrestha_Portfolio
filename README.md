Data Science Portfolio

My strong analytical skills have led me to explore a new career working with data. I am currently a Business/Data Analyst with Master of Medical Science Degree. 
I am currently in the process of building up a portfolio of projects on this Github repository to show how I approach different data sets and the skills that I am learning, as I up-skill myself further.
